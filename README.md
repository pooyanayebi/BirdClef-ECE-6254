# BirdClef-ECE-6254

The posed problem was to predict the probability of the presence of each of 264 East African bird species
based on audio recording data. The final approach
involved converting the audio training data to Mel
Spectograms to enable the use of a convolutional
neural network. The model was trained on a limited portion of the extensive training data, excluding the lowest quality recordings. The final model
achieved a 71% accuracy on the competitionâ€™s
hidden test set.
